## What's in this project?
This project includes the code of a website that organizes events that give out freebies. 
We were inspired to create this project because we like collecting freebies and we want it to be easier for students just like us to find free food, shirts, etc. 

## Tools we used
W3Schools
Glitch

##Challanges we overcame
One of the main challenges we faced was learning how to code and build a website from scratch. It was something that neither of us was familiar with, so there was a steep learning curve involved in the process. That was our biggest challenge that we overcame.
